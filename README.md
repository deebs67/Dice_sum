# Dice_sum  
In this repository we provide a Monte-Carlo simulation of the distribution of the sum of two dice throws. There are 1 billion (1E9) Monte-Carlo iterations in the simulation (where each iteration involves a pair of dice throws).  

The simulator is written in C# in file 'Program.cs', generating an executable file 'Dice_sum_Csharp.exe'. The '.exe' can be executed on any machine loaded with an appropriate version of the .NET runtime, which in practice is likely to require a Windows machine. It takes ~1 minute to execute on a modern Windows laptop.
